## Flow List

Below is the list of workflows I implemented and practiced during Module 2, progressing from basic concepts to full automation:

* **01_hello_world.yaml**: An introductory flow to explore Kestra's syntax, task structure, and basic execution behavior.
* **02_python.yaml**: Demonstrates how to orchestrate **Python scripts** within Kestra tasks for custom data processing logic.
* **03_getting_started_data_pipeline.yaml**: A fundamental ETL pipeline example to understand the core concepts of data extraction and transformation.
* **04_postgres_taxi.yaml**: A complete ETL pipeline that ingests **NYC Taxi data**, processes it, and loads the results into a **Postgres database**.
* **05_postgres_taxi_scheduled.yaml**: An automated version of the previous pipeline, configured with a **Schedule trigger** to run the ETL process periodically (e.g., monthly).
